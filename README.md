# SimplestIpLogger
The shittiest but simplest IpLogger you'll ever see.

## How to?
Just put this on a server with a PHP installation. I tested this on apache2 and php7.

URL: ``path.com/to/file.php?redirect=<url_to_redirect>``
Example: ``http://example.com/a/logger.php?redirect=http://github.com``

You can rename the logger file to hide it. You'll find the logged IPs in the ``ips.txt``.
